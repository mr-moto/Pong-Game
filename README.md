# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs.

## Setup

**Install:**

`> npm i`

**Run:**

`> npm start`

## Keys

**Player 1:**
* a: up
* z: down

**Player 2:**
* ▲ : up
* ▼: down

**Global Controls**
* Spacebar: pause
* n: 2nd Ball
* b: Small Ball
* m: Big Ball
* v: Mini Paddles

## Implementations
- Launch a second ball on 'n' key press
- Make ball radius smaller on 'b' key press
- Gameover screen once a player reaches a score of 10
- Color changing ball based on which player hits it

## Languages and Modules Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Git/Github
* Javascript
* Webpack/Babel
* ES2015

## Learnings
introduction to ES2015, babel and webpack has been a littl challenging due to the fact I was used to ES5 and gulp but later found that workflow is easier with these. Although webpack is similar to gulp, I find webpack easier to use and more efficient. This project challenged me to see how the modular aspect of each file worked together with the export/import function. Having never used SVGs to render objects was quite fun and suprisingly easy to use.

## TODO
* Fix 2nd ball reset on Gameover
* Implement speed
* Implement powerups inside the game so when a ball touches a power up icon that player has the option to use it.
* Better design
* Paused on start

* Change ball angle/speed depending on where it hits the paddle
* Implement CPU
* organize data in arrays and objects
